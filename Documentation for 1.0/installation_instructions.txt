To make use of the MetalBase program, you will need web server software
as well as PHP and MySQL. If you are a Windows user, the easiest way to 
get these is to download and install WampServer at: http://www.wampserver.com/en/

The developer of MetalBase (Richard Douglas) highly recommends installing WampServer 
as it comes with PhpMyAdmin which can be used to make importing the database 
(and deleting entries) much easier. 

For Mac and Linux users, there also exist MAMP servers and LAMP servers. 
The AMP is short for Apache MySQL PHP. The developer has not done web 
programming on Macs and Linux machines and cannot make any recommendations 
regarding MAMP and LAMP server software.

Once WampServer is installed, run it. An icon should appear somewhere in your system tray
(the lower right corner of the desktop). This icon can be used for visiting "LocalHost"
and the "www directory". 

Visit the "www directory" (this will open file explorer) and paste a copy of the MetalBase folder inside.
Now visit "LocalHost" (this will open your default web browser). If WampServer was installed correctly,
you should see your WampServer homepage. If the MetalBase folder is in the right place (the www directory),
you should see a link to "MetalBase" under the "Your Projects" heading of your WampServer homepage.
This link can be used for running MetalBase but there are some other steps to take before doing so.

On your WampServer homepage, there is also a link to "phpMyAdmin".  Run that and set up a root account.
It is recommended that you also set up a separate account for running database queries for MetalBase.

Login to phpMyAdmin and import the "MetalBase.sql" file in this directory. This will set up the
database tables so that storing elements, updating them, and adding new ones is now possible through
the MetalBase website. (You can also perform deletion through phpMyAdmin).
If you are having trouble, the internet has many phpMyAdmin tutorials.

Open MetalBase in file explorer (you can use WampServer's "www directory" to make this step easier) and
edit the "connect_to_db.inc.php" file in the Includes folder. 
Change 'mbuser' to a username for a phpMyAdmin account that can access the MetalBase database,
and change 'mbpassword' to its corresponding password. But keep the quotation marks!

If all goes well, you can now visit the MetalBase homepage and run the program to your heart's content.

If you are having trouble, you may contact the developer (Richard Douglas) at doug3230@mylaurier.ca
Don't worry, he's quite friendly!
