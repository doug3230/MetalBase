<div id="searchbyzone">
	<p>I also provide links to individual pages for viewing
	<ul>
		<li><a href="search_by_name.php">
			results by letter of the alphabet</a></li>
		<li><a href="search_by_genre.php">
			results by genre</a></li>
		<li><a href="search_by_country.php">
			results by country</a></li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Optional:</strong> Have the 3 above subpages be integrated into the navigation zone in a
	manner that is pleasing to the user (a dropdown menu perhaps).</p>
